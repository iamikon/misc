if no github account goto github.com and sign up, if you have an account then just proceed.

open a terminal

to associate your git with your github

enter

— $ git --config global user.name “YOUR NAME”
— $ git --config global user.email “YOUR GITHUB EMAIL”

to create a repo and a local version

go to your github page and create a repo
enter the repo
find the clone address and copy it, it will be something like
https://github.com/iamikon/OpenYourMouth.git
go to your terminal and enter

— $ git clone https://github.com/iamikon/OpenYourMouth.git

this downloads any files from your github repo and sets up a git directory

add your files and folders to the directory, in this example it would be OpenYourMouth
when your files are added and you are happy with any changes you made it is time to add and commit
you can do this separately or all in one command
to do it separately enter

— $ git add filename1 filename2

this adds the specific files but to add all files and all changes

— $ git add .

then it is time to commit your changes to your github repo

— $ git commit --message “some message here”

if you do not use --message your default editor will pop up and ask you to enter a message
to do all of the things above in one step

— $ git commit --all --message "some message here"

now go check your handy work on your github page!

to manage forks you have to first fork the desired repo from the github page
navigate to the repo you want to fork https://github.com/rikai/OpenYourMouth
on this page there is a green button and another button with the word Fork
you can use either of these to fork the repo to your account and have your own copy to edit and add to
clone the forked repo from your account

— $ git clone https://github.com/iamikon/OpenYourMouth.git

make all your changes and such as you would with a repo you created, everything is the same!
after all your changes are made and committed to your fork of the repo go back to the github site
go into your version of the repo and find the little button that says 'Pull Request'
click that to submit your changes to be merged into the original/master repository
